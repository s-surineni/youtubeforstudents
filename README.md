# YouTube for Students - Learning Focused Video Player

A specialized YouTube player Android app designed for students and learners who want to consume complex topics and long educational videos more effectively.

## Purpose

Traditional YouTube players can be overwhelming when learning complex subjects. This app helps you break down long videos into manageable, digestible sections, making it easier to:
- **Rewind and replay** specific parts without losing your place
- **Focus on one concept** at a time
- **Avoid information overload** from long videos
- **Build better learning habits** through structured video consumption

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Sectioned Video Playback
- **Configurable Duration**: Set how long each video section should be (e.g., 2, 5, 10, or 15 minutes)

### ðŸ“š Learning-Focused Design
- **Minimal Distractions**: Clean interface focused on content consumption

### ðŸŽ¨ User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on phones and tablets
- **Material Design 3**: Modern, accessible interface
- **Offline Capability**: Works with downloaded content (future feature)

## How to Use

### 1. Configure Section Duration
- Open the app settings
- Choose your preferred section duration (2, 5, 10, or 15 minutes)
- This determines how long each video segment will play

### 2. Play Videos in Sections
1. **Select a Video**: Choose from pre-loaded educational content or add your own
2. **Start Sectioned Playback**: Tap the "Play Section" button
3. **Watch Current Section**: The video plays for your configured duration
4. **Advance to Next Section**: Tap "Next Section" to continue
5. **Repeat**: Continue until you've watched the entire video

### 3. Add Custom Educational Videos
1. Find a YouTube video ID (the part after `v=` in YouTube URLs)
2. Paste it in the "YouTube Video ID" field
3. Click "Add Video" to include it in your learning library

## Getting YouTube Video IDs

To get a YouTube video ID:
1. Go to any YouTube video
2. Copy the URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
3. The video ID is the part after `v=` (in this case: `dQw4w9WgXcQ`)

## Learning Benefits

- **Better Retention**: Shorter sections help you absorb information more effectively
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Focus on one concept at a time
- **Active Learning**: Manual advancement encourages engagement
- **Flexible Pacing**: Set your own learning rhythm
- **Review-Friendly**: Easy to replay sections you need to review
